## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

*As Traffic manager, I do not allow a cargo manifest for a particular ship to be
registered in the system on a date when the ship is already occupied.*

### 1.2. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

## 2. Design - User Story Realization

## 2.1. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

# 3. Implementation

     public static String addCargoManifest(int vehicleId, String warehouseId, String baseDateTime, String type){
        String ret = null;
        try {
            String query = "INSERT INTO CARGO_MANIFEST(VEHICLEID, WAREHOUSEID, BASE_DATE_TIME, TYPE) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)";

            Connection connection = null;
            PreparedStatement statement;

            try {
                connection = App.getInstance().getCompany().getDatabaseConnection().getConnection();
                connection.setAutoCommit(false);
                statement = connection.prepareStatement(query);

                statement.setInt(1, vehicleId);
                statement.setString(2, warehouseId);
                statement.setString(3, baseDateTime);
                statement.setString(4, type);
                statement.addBatch();

                statement.executeBatch();
                connection.commit();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                try { connection.rollback(); } catch (SQLException ignored) {}
                ret = e.getMessage();
            }

        }catch (Exception e){
            ret = e.getMessage();
        }
        return ret;
    }
