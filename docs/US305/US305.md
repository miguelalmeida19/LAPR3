# US 305 - Route of Container

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

*As Client, I want to know the route of a specific container I am leasing.*

### 1.2. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

## 2. Design - User Story Realization

## 2.1. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

# 3. Implementation

    public static String getRouteOfContainer(String containerID, String clientReg) {
    String mCount = null;
    try {
    try (CallableStatement stm = App.getInstance().getCompany().getStatement().getConnection().prepareCall("{ ?=call getrouteofcontainer(?,?) }")) {
    stm.registerOutParameter(1, Types.VARCHAR);
    stm.setInt(2, Integer.parseInt(containerID));
    stm.setInt(3, Integer.parseInt(clientReg));
    stm.executeUpdate();
    mCount = stm.getString(1);
    }
    } catch (Exception e) {
    print(e.getMessage());
    }
    return mCount;
    }
