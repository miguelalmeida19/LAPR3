# 4. Tests

**Test 1:** Checks that the value returned cannot be null

      @Test
    void closestPortNotNull(){
        String date = "31/12/2020 18:31";
        DateTimeFormatter ft = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm");
        LocalDateTime date1 = LocalDateTime.parse(date, ft);
        Port p = closestPortController.closestPort("C4SQ2",date1);
        assertNotNull(p);
    }
}
