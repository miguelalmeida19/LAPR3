# Who do I talk to?
In case you have any problem, please email Nuno Bettencourt (nmb@isep.ipp.pt).

# How do I use Maven?

## How to run unit tests?

Execute the "test" goals.

```shell
$ mvn test
```
## How to generate the javadoc for source code?

Execute the "javadoc:javadoc" goal.

```shell
$ mvn javadoc:javadoc
```
This generates the source code javadoc in folder "target/site/apidocs/index.html".

## How to generate the javadoc for test cases code?

Execute the "javadoc:test-javadoc" goal.

```shell
$ mvn javadoc:test-javadoc
```
This generates the test cases javadoc in folder "target/site/testapidocs/index.html".

## How to generate Jacoco's Code Coverage Report?

Execute the "jacoco:report" goal.

```shell
$ mvn test jacoco:report
```

This generates a jacoco code coverage report in folder "target/site/jacoco/index.html".

## How to generate PIT Mutation Code Coverage?

Execute the "org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage" goal.

```shell
$ mvn test org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage
```
This generates a PIT Mutation coverage report in folder "target/pit-reports/YYYYMMDDHHMI".

## How to combine different maven goals in one step?

You can combine different maven goals in the same command. For example, to locally run your project just like on jenkins, use:

```shell
$ mvn clean test jacoco:report org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage
```
## How to perform a faster pit mutation analysis?

Do not clean build => remove "clean"

Reuse the previous report => add "-Dsonar.pitest.mode=reuseReport"

Use more threads to perform the analysis. The number is dependent on each computer CPU => add "-Dthreads=4"

Temporarily remove timestamps from reports.

Example:
```shell
$ mvn test jacoco:report org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage -DhistoryInputFile=target/fasterPitMutationTesting-history.txt -DhistoryOutputFile=target/fasterPitMutationTesting-history.txt -Dsonar.pitest.mode=reuseReport -Dthreads=4 -DtimestampedReports=false
```
## Where do I configure my database connection?

Each group should configure their database connection on the file:
* src/main/resources/application.properties
